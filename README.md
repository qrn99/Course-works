### Third Year
  1. MAT335 Fractals, Chaos, and Dynamics
      - Coding + Math Problem Sets (temporarily private)
      - Essays with the theme of Fractals, Chaos & Dynamics, and a final essay 
        that integrate the three essays as a whole
  2. STA302 Methods of Data Analysis I
      - R coding project with a video presentation on
         - _MiniProject#1_: running simulations to examine the properties of the least square 
           regression, its inference tests, and how it models the true population 
           relation:
            - the properties of unbiased estimators (sample mean, variance)
           under the impacts of sample size and error variances
            - whether the construction of a confidence interval produces consistent 
              results with its definition
         - _MiniProject#2_: running simulations to examine the properties of multivariable linear 
           regression and diagnostic check to observe and understand:
            - how correlated predictors affect the sample estimators
            - how model diagnostics work when the true model is non-linear
      - A formal report (_final project_) on:
        - how to pick a linear model for systolic blood pressure 
        given the `NHANES` dataset using various model selection techniques as well as 
        model diagnostics & validation
        - discuss the effect of chosen predictors 
        on the combined systolic blood pressure reading
  3. HPS390 History of Mathematics Before 1700
      - Essay: History of US' New Math Education Movement
    
### Forth Year
  1. CSC207 Software Design
      - Worked on the backend for the messaging system and TextUI for the Convention 
        Manager program (group project) in Java and testing with JUnit 
      - Check the [separate repository](https://github.com/qrn99/CSC207H1-ConventionManager.git) for details
  2. STA314 Statistics Machine Learning I
      - Coded associated functions in R with an R markdown file of vignette on how to:
        -  _A1_: Use k-mean clustering algorithm to produce a cross-stitch pattern 
           guidance given an image
        -  _A2_: Use a logistic lasso model (with coordinate descent and tuning 
           with cross validation) to perform classification on data by 
           `tidymodels` workflow
